                                <p>It is our policy to expeditiously respond to proper notices of alleged copyright
                                    infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act
                                    (DMCA), (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site,
                                    http://www.copyright.gov).</p>
                                <p>It is expected that all users of any part of MUO.com will comply with applicable
                                    copyright laws. If, however, we receive proper notification of claimed copyright
                                    infringement, our response to such notices will include removing or disabling access
                                    to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating
                                    contributors, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under
                                    United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.</p>
                                <p>
                                    If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a
                                    good-faith attempt to contact the creator of the affected content so that they may
                                    make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We
                                    may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.
